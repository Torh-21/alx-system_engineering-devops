This is the README file for the 0x03-shell_variables_expansions directory.
The 0-alias script creates an alias.
The 1-hello_you script prints hello user, where user is the current Linux user.
The 2-path script adds /action to the PATH. /action should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program.
The 3-paths script counts the number of directories in the PATH.
